# Building Deep Research

## How I do Deep Research

Usually I do research to help someone, write about something or to learn something new. I start with basic reading and then branch myself to more specific topics while practicing and experimenting.

And when I feel confident enough with almost usable knowledge, I write about it and in the process I start looking for books if I want to go deeper and fill the gaps.

For instance, I'm reading about deep research atm, first thing I did is to lookup articles, have few opens atm and reading both practical approaches and blogs how people use deep research.

## How to Automate Deep Research

I can imagine an AI Agent that have a "confirmer" agent that would confirm the research plan with user and a planner that would create tasks for subagents to research specific thing and then having this result to another subagent that would synthesize the result into an artifact.

## What Would I like it to do.

I think I'm good at visual learning so I'd like the agent to use markdown extensively to illustrate concepts as well as using math formulas to explain topics.
