## Overview

Plan-and-Solve (PS+) is an enhanced zero-shot prompting technique that improves upon Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by addressing three common error types:
1. **Calculation errors** - Mistakes in mathematical operations
2. **Missing-step errors** - Skipping necessary reasoning steps
3. **Semantic misunderstanding** - Misinterpreting the problem

### Key Innovation

PS+ uses a **two-phase approach**:

1. **Planning Phase**: Understand the problem and devise a plan by breaking it into smaller subtasks
2. **Execution Phase**: Carry out the plan step-by-step with careful attention to calculations

### Enhanced Instructions (PS+)

In addition to the basic PS prompting, PS+ includes:
- **Extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals**
- **Calculate intermediate results (pay attention to calculation and commonsense)**

## Features

- ✅ **Two-phase reasoning**: Planning → Execution
- ✅ **Variable extraction**: Automatically identifies and tracks relevant variables
- ✅ **Careful calculation**: Explicit instructions for accurate math operations
- ✅ **Self-consistency**: Optional majority voting across multiple reasoning paths
- ✅ **Structured output**: Zod schemas for type-safe results
- ✅ **Multiple reasoning domains**: Arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning

## Installation

This implementation is part of the `@deepagents/orchestrator` package.

```typescript
import {
  planAndSolveAgent,
  createPlanAndSolveAgent,
  planAndSolveWithSelfConsistency,
  runSinglePath,
  runSelfConsistency,
  compareApproaches,
} from '@deepagents/orchestrator/plan-and-solve';
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Single Path)

```typescript
import { execute, user, toOutput } from '@deepagents/agent';
import { planAndSolveAgent } from './plan-and-solve-agent';
import type { PlanAndSolveOutput } from './types';

const problem = 'A baker made 23 cupcakes. He sold 18 of them in the morning and made 15 more in the afternoon. How many cupcakes does he have now?';

const result = execute(planAndSolveAgent, [user(problem)], {});
const output = (await toOutput(result)) as PlanAndSolveOutput;

console.log('Final Answer:', output.final_answer);
console.log('Plan:', output.plan);
console.log('Variables:', output.variables);
```

### Self-Consistency Mode

Self-consistency generates multiple reasoning paths and uses majority voting to select the most reliable answer.

```typescript
import { planAndSolveWithSelfConsistency } from './self-consistency';

const problem = 'If 5 apples cost $10, how much do 8 apples cost?';

const result = await planAndSolveWithSelfConsistency(problem, 10);

console.log('Majority Answer:', result.majority_answer);
console.log('Confidence:', result.confidence_score);
console.log('Vote Distribution:', result.vote_distribution);
```

### Using the Demo Runner

The easiest way to explore the implementation:

```bash
# Quick demo with a single problem
node run-demo.ts quick

# Self-consistency demonstration
node run-demo.ts self-consistency

# Compare single-path vs self-consistency
node run-demo.ts compare

# Run all examples
node run-demo.ts all

# Arithmetic reasoning examples
node run-demo.ts arithmetic

# Symbolic reasoning examples
node run-demo.ts symbolic

# Commonsense reasoning examples
node run-demo.ts commonsense

# Custom problem
node run-demo.ts custom "Your problem here"

# Show help

```

Or using the npm script (if configured):

```bash
npm run plan-and-solve [mode]
```

## API Reference

### Agent

#### `planAndSolveAgent`

The main PS+ agent with default settings (temperature=0).

```typescript
const planAndSolveAgent: Agent<PlanAndSolveOutput>;
```

#### `createPlanAndSolveAgent(temperature)`

Create a PS+ agent with custom temperature.

```typescript
function createPlanAndSolveAgent(temperature?: number): Agent<PlanAndSolveOutput>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `temperature` (optional): Temperature for generation (default: 0)
  - Use 0 for deterministic reasoning
  - Use 0.7 for diverse paths in self-consistency

### Functions

#### `runSinglePath(problem)`

Execute PS+ reasoning on a single problem with deterministic output.

```typescript
async function runSinglePath(problem: string): Promise<PlanAndSolveOutput>;
```

#### `runSelfConsistency(problem, numPaths?)`

Execute PS+ with self-consistency (multiple paths + majority voting).

```typescript
async function runSelfConsistency(
  problem: string,
  numPaths?: number
): Promise<SelfConsistencyResult>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `problem`: The problem to solve
- `numPaths` (optional): Number of reasoning paths to generate (default: 10)

#### `planAndSolveWithSelfConsistency(problem, numPaths?)`

Low-level function for self-consistency without console output.

```typescript
async function planAndSolveWithSelfConsistency(
  problem: string,
  numPaths?: number
): Promise<SelfConsistencyResult>;
```

#### `compareApproaches(problem, numPaths?)`

Compare single-path vs self-consistency side-by-side.

```typescript
async function compareApproaches(
  problem: string,
  numPaths?: number
): Promise<{
  singlePath: PlanAndSolveOutput;
  selfConsistency: SelfConsistencyResult;
  answersMatch: boolean;
}>;
```

#### `analyzeReasoningDiversity(results)`

Analyze the diversity of reasoning paths in self-consistency results.

```typescript
function analyzeReasoningDiversity(results: SelfConsistencyResult): {
  uniqueAnswers: number;
  entropy: number;
  diversityScore: number;
};
```

## Type Definitions

### `PlanAndSolveOutput`

interface PlanAndSolveOutput {
  understanding: string;                  // Problem understanding
  plan: string[];                         // List of subtasks
  variables: Record<string, string | number>;  // Extracted variables
  reasoning_steps: ReasoningStep[];       // Step-by-step execution
  calculations?: {                        // Optional calculations
    expression: string;

## Example Problems

The implementation includes example problems across three reasoning categories:

### Arithmetic Reasoning
- Simple calculations
- Multi-step problems
- Word problems with multiple operations

### Symbolic Reasoning
- Pattern recognition
- Sequence completion
- Logical deduction

### Commonsense Reasoning

All examples are available in `examples.ts` via the `EXAMPLE_PROBLEMS` export.

## Performance Characteristics

Based on the paper's findings:

| Method | Arithmetic | Symbolic | Commonsense |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Zero-shot CoT | Baseline | Baseline | Baseline |
| PS (Basic) | +2.0% | +1.5% | +1.2% |
| **PS+ (Enhanced)** | **+4.5%** | **+3.2%** | **+2.8%** |
| PS+ w/ Self-Consistency | **+6.8%** | **+5.1%** | **+4.3%** |

*Approximate improvements over Zero-shot CoT baseline*

## Configuration

### Temperature Settings

- **Temperature = 0** (Default)
  - Deterministic reasoning
  - Consistent outputs
  - Best for single-path reasoning

- **Temperature = 0.7** (Self-Consistency)
  - Diverse reasoning paths
  - Multiple solution approaches
  - Required for self-consistency

### Number of Paths (Self-Consistency)

- **N = 5**: Quick self-consistency check
- **N = 10** (Default): Balanced performance
- **N = 20+**: Maximum reliability (slower)

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Structure

The PS+ prompt includes:

1. **System Context**: Role definition
2. **Identity**: Task description
3. **Instructions**: Detailed two-phase guidance
   - Phase 1: Understanding & Planning
   - Phase 2: Execution with calculations
4. **Output Format**: Structured response requirements
5. **Examples**: Demonstrations of good reasoning

### Key Differentiators from Zero-shot CoT

| Aspect | Zero-shot CoT | Plan-and-Solve Plus |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Approach | "Let's think step by step" | Two-phase: Plan → Execute |
| Variables | Not extracted | Explicitly extracted |
| Calculations | Implicit | Explicit with verification |
| Missing steps | Common | Addressed by planning |
| Structure | Freeform | Structured output |

## Limitations

- **Model Dependency**: Performance depends on base model capabilities
- **Complex Problems**: May still struggle with very complex multi-step problems
- **Numerical Precision**: Calculation accuracy limited by model's math abilities
- **Self-Consistency Cost**: Multiple paths increase API calls and latency

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Integration with external calculators for verified arithmetic
- [ ] Dynamic plan adaptation based on intermediate results
- [ ] Confidence scoring for individual reasoning steps
- [ ] Automatic problem categorization
- [ ] Few-shot examples for domain-specific problems
