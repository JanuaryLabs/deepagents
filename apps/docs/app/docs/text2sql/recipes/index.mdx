description: Pre-built teachable bundles for common domains and use cases
---

Recipes are curated collections of teachables designed for specific industries and use cases. Each recipe provides copy-paste ready code that teaches Text2SQL the terminology, rules, and patterns specific to your domain.

## Available Recipes

| Recipe | Domain | Key Focus |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| [E-Commerce](/docs/text2sql/recipes/e-commerce) | Retail, Orders, Customers | Revenue metrics, customer analytics, cart abandonment |
| [Finance](/docs/text2sql/recipes/finance) | Banking, Investments | Loan analysis, portfolio metrics, compliance |
| [Healthcare](/docs/text2sql/recipes/healthcare) | Clinical, Patient Data | HIPAA compliance, patient cohorts, clinical metrics |

## How Recipes Work

Each recipe provides:

1. **Domain Terms** - Vocabulary specific to the industry (AOV, NPL, LOS, etc.)
2. **Guardrails** - Safety rules and compliance requirements
3. **Hints** - Default behaviors and assumptions
4. **Examples** - Sample question → SQL pairs for pattern matching
5. **Clarifications** - When to ask users for more information

## Quick Start

Copy the teachables bundle from any recipe into your code:

```typescript
import {
  term,
  hint,
  guardrail,
  example,
  clarification,
} from '@deepagents/text2sql';

// Paste the recipe's teachables here
text2sql.instruct(
  term('AOV', 'Average Order Value - total revenue divided by number of orders'),
  hint('Active customer = ordered in last 90 days unless specified'),
  // ... more teachables from the recipe
);
```

## Combining Recipes

You can combine multiple recipes for cross-domain applications:

```typescript
// E-commerce + Finance for a retail analytics platform
text2sql.instruct(
  // E-commerce terms
  term('AOV', 'Average Order Value'),
  term('LTV', 'Lifetime Value'),

  // Finance terms for payment processing
  term('chargeback', 'disputed transaction returned to customer'),
  term('settlement', 'transfer of funds from processor to merchant'),
);
```

## Customizing Recipes

Recipes are starting points. Customize them for your specific needs:

```typescript
// Override a term with your company's definition
term('active customer', 'customer who purchased in the last 60 days'),

// Add company-specific guardrails
guardrail({
  rule: 'Never query the legacy_orders table',
  reason: 'Deprecated - use orders_v2 instead',
}),

// Add examples for your specific schema
example({
  question: 'show me VIP customers',
  sql: 'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE tier = \'VIP\' ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC',
}),
```

## Creating Your Own Recipe

Use `teach()` to auto-generate teachables based on your schema:

```typescript
const result = await text2sql.teach(`
  Our ${domain} database tracks:
  - [describe your main entities]
  - [explain key relationships]
  - [define important business rules]
`);

console.log(result.teachables); // Generated teachables to review
```

Then refine the generated teachables and save them as your custom recipe.
