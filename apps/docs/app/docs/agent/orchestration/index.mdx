description: Patterns for multi-agent coordination
---

Multi-agent systems require coordination patterns. When one agent needs another agent's help, you have two fundamental approaches—each with distinct control flow characteristics.

This section covers:

- [Subagents](/docs/agent/orchestration/subagents) - Choosing between asTool and Handoffs
- [Handoffs](/docs/agent/orchestration/handoffs) - Agent-to-agent delegation
- [Agents as Tools](/docs/agent/orchestration/agents-as-tools) - Encapsulated agent calls
