A software engineer can be an AI engineer but you cannot be an AI engineer without being a software engineer first which means you need to understand how code works, how to structure it, debug it and deploy softwares. You need to learn architecture design patterns, data structures and algorithms, version control systems like git, testing methodologies, and CI/CD pipelines.

You also need to be familiar with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure since most AI applications are deployed on the cloud. Understanding containerization tools like Docker. You need to get hands-on experience with sandboxing early on to understand how to safely run AI models.

I can list more if you want. You might think this is exaggerated but trust me, getting an AI Agent from first-glance impressive to production-ready is a long journey that requires a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices.
