A deepresearch cycle goes as follows:

1. Ensuring we have proper understanding of the research topic by refining the research question with the user.
2. Generating a research brief.
3. Generating a research outline based on the research brief.
4. For each point in the research outline:
   - Gather search sources (web links or local files).
   - Conduct searches using the sources.
   - Collate the search results, condensing them into concise response.
   - Reflect on the response and check if it is sufficiently addressing the research point or if further research is needed.
5. Compile the research points into a comprehensive research document.
6. Generate report.
